        This is a local recognizer that offers automatic phoneme recognition
        using
        <a href="https://github.com/persephone-tools/persephone">Persephone</a>,
        an open-source automatic phoneme transcription tool.  The user
        is able to select a tier in the current transcript, and provides
        the name of the directory containing a Persephone training corpus
        and a model that has been trained on it (for now, using the default
        Persephone 'basic experiment' model settings).  This recognizer
        then processes the contents of those annotations, producing a new
        tier containing the automatically recognized phoneme strings that
        Persephone has generated.
